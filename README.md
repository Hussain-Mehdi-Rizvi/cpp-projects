## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is played between two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)
- 3x3 grid for classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience
- Error handling for invalid moves
- Winner detection and draw condition

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol (`X` or `O`) in one of the 9 available spaces on the grid.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
4. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
